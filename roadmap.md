# View the Roadmap
The roadmap is defined in the [project view](https://github.com/orgs/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/projects/5) 
The project view contains all the issues that have been triaged and potentially assigned to a Sprint.   

The view is the source of truth and they are kept up to date to showing our roadmap.

# Usage of Epics
An Epic is a grouping of smaller related issues/tasks that fits into a larger goal. An Epic can potentially span across multiple iterations. 

To track how smaller issues fit into the larger goal, we use [task lists](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-task-lists).
Breaking a large issue into smaller issues makes the work more manageable and enables team members to work in parallel. 
It also leads to smaller pull requests, which are easier to review.

>NOTE: To create an epic on Github, use the available Epic template.

# Usage of Github issue template/forms
We have [customized templates](https://github.com/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/ffm-project/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/epic.md) that helps contributors in 
creating new issues in the repository. When creating an issue, choose the template that best fits the issue you are about to create.  

# Communicate
- Use `@bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/factorized-fleet` to alert the team about the issue. 
- Use appropriate labels during the creation or the triaging of the issue. Labels help to categorise issues thus improving their discoverbility. Check out the existing labels on - https://github.com/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/ffm-project/labels.  
- Assign collaborators to issues to communicate responsibility.

>NOTE: You can always reach out to the wider team via the available [communication channels](https://github.com/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/ffm-project/wiki/How-to-communicate-in-the-project) 

# Assigning issue to a Sprint

A Sprint is defined as an [iteration field](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/best-practices-for-managing-projects#use-different-field-types) in the GitHub project view. An issue is assigned to a Sprint during Sprint planning.

To assign an issue to a Sprint, go to the [Project table view](https://github.com/orgs/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/projects/5/views/4?layout=table) which contains the `Sprint` column. 
Look for the issue you are interested in. Then on the Sprint column, you could select a Sprint from the drop down list and assign it to the issue.

# How to add an issue to the Roadmap

To add an issue to the Roadmap, go the [project](https://github.com/orgs/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/projects/5) and click on the `Add Item` button (displayed down the board). 
Github will propose a search input, where you can search for issues and add them to the board.

# Filtering the Roadmap

On the project you could filter by Label, Sprint, assignee, Status etc. See the [available filtering options](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/tracking-work-with-project-boards/filtering-cards-on-a-project-board) 

## Show only Epic

To show Epics, use the filter `label: kind/epic`. This will show only larger goals issue.

## Show Issues in a Sprint

To show issues that are being progressed in a Spring `X`, use the filter `sprint:X` (where `X` is Sprint value).
To show all issues in the current Sprint use the `sprint:@current` filter.

# Usage of Milestone
Milestones will be used as rough outlines of work assigned to a quarter. A milestone can be assigned to a smaller issue or an epic.
Check out the available milestones - https://github.com/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/ffm-project/milestones.
